Commits
- 2c23853 chore(lock): update package-lock for sql.js; fixes Render npm ci mismatch
- 7f05d79 fix(server): add grammarSpanGenerator util and include choices for grammar_span; fix MODULE_NOT_FOUND on Render
- 0f6b8ed fix(server): remove broken unicode fallback in grammar_span choices; use generator-provided choices only

What changed
- Fixed Render build by syncing lockfile (sqlite3 → sql.js).
- Added grammar span generator util; routes now send `choices` for grammar items.
- Removed unicode fallback causing parse errors.

Where we are
- Server: builds and runs with sql.js; grammar routes stabilized.
- Client: pending Vercel redeploy with Root=`client` and `REACT_APP_API_URL` env.

Next
- Switch Render to Starter + Disk (`DB_FILE=/var/data/loe.db`) for persistent DB.
- Redeploy client from latest commit; verify Study flow end-to-end.

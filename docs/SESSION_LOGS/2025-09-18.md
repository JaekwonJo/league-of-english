# Session Log â€” 2025-09-18

What we focused on
- Helped user reach `http://localhost:3000` again by starting `npm run dev:all` from Windows PowerShell.
- Confirmed the client responds with HTTP 200 via curl (WSL and PowerShell).
- Investigated WSL failure: `nodemon` missing because Node is not installed on the Linux side.
- Killed the stray Windows Node process holding port 5000 after a crash.

Notes
- Front-end runs from Windows PowerShell; ports 3000/5000 are open.
- WSL environment still needs Node 20 before tmux-based dev will work.
- Added documentation updates (README, TODO, ADR addendum, memory sync).

Next
- Install Node 20 (or nvm) inside WSL and retry combined dev mode there.
- Script a simple health check (`npm run dev:check`) to fail fast when ports are busy.
- Resume Phase 2 PDF parser tasks once environment is stable again.

# Session Log 2025-09-18

What we focused on
- Helped user reach `http://localhost:3000` again by starting `npm run dev:all` from Windows PowerShell.
- Confirmed the client responds with HTTP 200 using curl from PowerShell.
- Removed the unused Linux dev path and documented the PowerShell-only workflow.
- Killed the stray Windows Node process holding port 5000 after a crash.

Notes
- Front-end runs from Windows PowerShell; ports 3000/5000 are open.
- Added documentation updates (README, TODO, ADR addendum, memory sync).

Next
- Script a simple health check (`npm run dev:check`) to fail fast when ports are busy.
- Resume Phase 2 PDF parser tasks once environment guardrails are in place.

      "passage": "It is a common assumption that most vagrant birds are\nultimately doomed, aside from the rare cases where\nindividuals are able to reorientate and return to their\nnormal ranges. In turn, it is also commonly assumed\nthat  vagrancy ① itself  is  a  relatively  unimportant\nbiological  phenomenon.  This  is  undoubtedly  true  for\nthe majority of cases, as the most likely outcome of\nany given vagrancy event is ② that the individual will\nfail  to  find  enough  resources,  and/or  be  exposed  to\ninhospitable  environmental  conditions,  and  perish.\nHowever,  there  are  many  lines  of  evidence ③ to\nsuggest  that  vagrancy  can,  on  rare  occasions,\ndramatically  alter  the  fate  of  populations,  species  or\neven  whole  ecosystems.  Despite  being  infrequent,\nthese  events  can  be  extremely  important  when ④\nviewing  at  the  timescales  over  which  ecological  and\nevolutionary  processes  unfold.  The  most  profound\nconsequences of vagrancy relate to the establishment\nof  new  breeding  sites,  new  migration  routes  and\nwintering locations. Each of these can occur through\ndifferent  mechanisms,  and  at  different  frequencies,\nand they ⑤ each have their own unique importance.\n97.\n98.\n99.\n100.\n(",

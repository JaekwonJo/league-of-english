According to the threat to self-\nesteem model, help can be perceived as supportive and\nloving, or it can be seen as threatening if that help is\ninterpreted  as  implying  <u>competence.</u>  According  to\nBurke and Goren, support is especially likely to be seen\nas threatening if it is in an area that is self-relevant or\nself-defining – that is, in an area where your own success\nand  <u>achievement are especially important.</u> Receiving\nhelp  with  a  self-relevant  task  can  make  you  feel  bad\nabout yourself, and this can  <u>undermine the potential\npositive  effects  of  the  help.</u>  For  example,  if  your  self-\nconcept rests, in part, on your great cooking ability, it\nmay be a  <u>blow to your ego when a friend helps you\nprepare a meal for guests because it suggests that you’re\nnot the master chef you thought you were.</u>",

After graduating from high school, she\nprepared for an audition at the Curtis Institute of Music, but her\napplication was rejected, which she attributed to racial\ndiscrimination. To fund her private lessons, she began performing\nin Atlantic City, adopting the stage name “Nina Simone.” In the\n1960s, she became a supporter of the Civil Rights Movement and\ncomposed and performed songs as a response to racism and\nviolence in the Southern United States.

When your hand is hanging at your side and then you lift it, opposing muscles on your upper arm shorten and lengthen― contract and relax―to bend the elbow. Biceps contract, and triceps relax. Reversing the motion, when you drop your hand back down, muscles (a)reverse roles. Triceps contract, and biceps relax. Lift your hand or drop it, and muscle shows what it is: a system of coordination, managed by orchestrated tension. As arms and legs rotate around joints, muscles activate and deactivate, contract and relax. All physical activity is (b)paradoxical, in this sense: Movement depends on what muscles don’t do, as much as it depends on what they do. Both are necessary, each in its time―and the same is true of each side of the pairs of concepts shaping how we talk of muscles. Start with nature versus nurture: Some people are stronger or more muscular than others; is the difference (c)inborn, or does it depend on what people do? To the latter question: What do you do? Do you have to lift weights, or is walking enough exercise? How should you do the exercise? Should you move fast or slowly? Lift heavy weights or lighter ones? Put like that, basic questions about muscle may sound like they have one right answer. Oppositions can polarize. But where muscle is concerned, (d)few oppositions are true polarities. Look closely, and most prove to be paradoxes. Born and made, heavy and light, fast and slow: Those opposites actually (e)exclude each other. *biceps: 이두근 **triceps: 삼두근"

Sam wasn’t just anyone—he was the little boy living next door that Jason had babysat every summer break. (a)He had played in the park and spent summer afternoons chasing ice cream trucks with Sam. (B) When the whistle blew, Jason started strong, but since he hadn’t run for so long, his energy faded quickly.

In the crowd, Sam was holding a sign: “Thank you, Runners!” Jason smiled. (d)He was all the motivation needed. (D) Seeing Sam’s name on the banner made everything feel personal.

As the parent of a gifted child, you need to be aware of
a certain common parent trap. Of course you are a
proud parent, and you should be. While it is very easy
to talk nonstop about your little genius and his or her
remarkable behavior, this can be very stressful on your
child. It is extremely important to
 . Gifted children feel pressured when
their parents show them off too much. This behavior
creates expectations that they may not be able to live
up to, and also creates a false sense of self for your
child. You want your child to be who they are, not who
they seem to be as defined by their incredible
achievements. If not, you could end up with a driven
perfectionist child or perhaps a drop-out, or worse.

② keep in mind how much you express your child's genius
③ share every detail of your child's developmental stages
④ constantly conceal your child's incredible
accomplishments
⑤ take pride in your parenting skills and discipline

One valuable technique for getting out of helplessness,
depression, and situations which are predominantly
being run by the thought, “I can’t,” is to choose to be
with other persons who have resolved the problem
with which we struggle. This is one of the great powers
of self-help groups. When we are in a negative state,
we have given a lot of energy to negative thought
forms, and the positive thought forms are weak. Those
who are in a higher vibration are free of the energy
from their negative thoughts and have energized
positive thought forms. Merely to be in their
 is beneficial. In some self-help groups, this is
called “hanging out with the winners.” The benefit here
is on the psychic level of consciousness, and there is a
transfer of positive energy and relighting of one’s own
latent positive thought forms.
① being in a particular place or time
② a state where there lacks of something
③ a state that doesn’t exist in a given time
④ a specific feeling or mood induced by something
⑤ pouring lots of attention or energy to something

Our emotions are thought to exist because they have
 . Fear has helped us avoid dangers,
expressing anger helps us scare off threats, and
expressing positive emotions helps us bond with
others. From an evolutionary perspective, an emotion
is a kind of “program” that, when triggered, directs
many of our activities (including attention, perception,
memory, movement, expressions, etc.). For example,
fear makes us very attentive, narrows our perceptual
focus to threatening stimuli, will cause us either to face
a situation (fight) or avoid it (flight), and may cause us
to remember an experience more acutely (so that we
avoid the threat in the future). Regardless of the
specific ways in which they activate our systems, the
specific emotions we possess are thought to exist
because they have helped us (as a species) survive
challenges within our environment long ago. If they
had not helped us adapt and survive, they would not
have evolved with us.
① arose from social interactions
② are chiefly based on cultural factors
③ are meaningful in contemporary society
④ relsult from neurological and physical processes
⑤ have played a part in our species' survival

Every time a new medium comes along — whether it’s
the invention of the printed book, or TV, or SNS — and
you start to use it, it’s like you are putting on a new
kind of goggles, with their own special colors and
lenses. Each set of goggles you put on makes you see
things differently. So when you start to watch
television, before you absorb the message of any
particular TV show — whether it’s Wheel of Fortune or
The Wire — you start to see the world as
 . That’s why Marshall McLuhan said that every
time a new medium comes along — a new way for
humans to communicate — it has buried in it a
message. It is gently guiding us to see the world
according to a new set of codes. The way information
gets to you, McLuhan argued, is more important than
the information itself. TV teaches you that the world is
fast; that it’s about surfaces and appearances.

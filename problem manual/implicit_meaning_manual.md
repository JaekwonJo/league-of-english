Whales are highly efficient at carbon storage. When
they die, each whale sequesters an average of 30 tons
of carbon dioxide, taking that carbon out of the
atmosphere for centuries. For comparison, the average
tree absorbs only 48 pounds of CO2 a year. From a
climate perspective, each whale is the marine
equivalent of thousands of trees. Whales also help
sequester carbon by fertilizing the ocean as they
release nutrient-rich waste, in turn increasing
phytoplankton populations, which also sequester
carbon ― leading some scientists to call them the
“engineers of marine ecosystems.” In 2019,
economists from the International Monetary Fund
(IMF) estimated the value of the ecosystem services
provided by each whale at over $2 million USD. They
called for a new global program of economic incentives
to return whale populations to preindustrial whaling
levels as one example of a “nature-based solution” to
climate change. Calls are now being made for a global
whale restoration program, to slow down climate
change.

You hear again and again that some of the greatest
composers were misunderstood in their own day. Not
everyone could understand the compositions of
Beethoven, Brahms, or Stravinsky in their day. The
reason for this initial lack of acceptance is
unfamiliarity. The musical forms, or ideas expressed
within them, were completely new. And yet, this is
exactly one of the things that makes them so great.
Effective composers have their own ideas. Have you
ever seen the classic movie Amadeus? The composer
Antonio Salieri is the “host” of this movie; he’s
depicted as one of the most famous non-great
composers ― he lived at the time of Mozart and was
completely overshadowed by him. Now, Salieri wasn’t
a bad composer; in fact, he was a very good one. But
he wasn’t one of the world’s great composers because
his work wasn’t original. What he wrote sounded
just like what everyone else was composing at
the time.
① His works were distinguishable from others'
② His compositions missed novelty and unusualness
③ His music was not known to the public at the time
④ His compositions were too complex to be comprehend
⑤ His music was full of emotions, different from the ones
used by others

Every time a new medium comes along — whether it’s
the invention of the printed book, or TV, or SNS — and
you start to use it, it’s like you are putting on a new
kind of goggles, with their own special colors and
lenses. Each set of goggles you put on makes you see
things differently. So when you start to watch
television, before you absorb the message of any
particular TV show — whether it’s Wheel of Fortune or
The Wire — you start to see the world as being shaped
like television itself. That’s why Marshall McLuhan said
that every time a new medium comes along — a new
way for humans to communicate — it has buried in it a
message. It is gently guiding us to see the world
according to a new set of codes. The way information
gets to you, McLuhan argued, is more important than
the information itself. TV teaches you that the world is
fast; that it’s about surfaces and appearances.

다음 글에서 밑줄 친 “luminiferious ether”에 대한 설명
으로 옳은 것은? [33]
Concepts are vital to human survival, but we must also
be careful with them because concepts open the door
to essentialism. They encourage us to see things that
aren’t present. Stuart Firestein opens his book,
Ignorance, with an old proverb, “It is very difficult to
find a black cat in a dark room, especially when there
is no cat.” This statement beautifully sums up the
search for essences. History has many examples of
scientists who searched fruitlessly for an essence
because they used the wrong concept to guide their
hypotheses. Firestein gives the example of
luminiferous ether, a mysterious substance that was
thought to fill the universe so that light would have a
medium to move through. The ether was a black cat,
writes Firestein, and physicists had been theorizing in
a dark room, and then experimenting in it, looking for
evidence of a cat that did not exist.
① a form of energy that is seldom found in the natural
world
② a material that was eventually confirmed to exist
③ a mysterious form of dark force used by Jedi masters
④ a measure used by scientists to identify the speed of
light
⑤ a non-existent medium that scientists believed light
moved through

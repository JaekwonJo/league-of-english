One valuable technique for getting out of helplessness,
depression,  and  situations  which  are  predominantly
being run by the thought, “I can’t,” is to choose to be
with other persons ① who have resolved the problem
which we struggle. This is ② one great power of self-
help groups. When we are in a negative state, we have
given a lot of energy to negative thought forms, and
the  positive  thought  forms  are  weak. ③ Those  in  a
higher  vibration  are  free  of  the  energy  from  their
negative thoughts and have energized positive thought
forms. ④ Just being around them is beneficial. In some
self-help groups, this is called “hanging out with the
winners.” The benefit here is on the psychic level of
consciousness,  and  there  is  a  transfer  of  positive
energy  and ⑤ relighting  one’s  own  latent  positive
thought forms.

Our emotions are thought to exist because they have
contributed to our survival as a species. Fear has ①
helped  us  avoid  dangers,  expressing  anger  helps  us
scare  off  threats,  and  expressing  positive  emotions
helps  us  bond  with  others.  From  an  evolutionary
perspective, an emotion is a kind of “program” that, ②
when  triggered,  directs  many  of  our  activities
(including attention, perception, memory, movement,
expressions,  etc.).  For  example,  fear  makes  us  very
attentive, narrows our perceptual focus to threatening
stimuli, will cause us either to face a situation (fight)
or ③ avoids it (flight), and may cause us to remember
an  experience  more  acutely  (so  that  we  avoid  the
threat in the future). Regardless of the specific ways in
which they activate our systems, the specific emotions
we possess ④ are thought to exist because they have
helped us (as a species) survive challenges within our
environment long ago. If they ⑤ had not helped us
adapt and survive, they would not have evolved with
us.

Every time a new medium comes along — whether it’s
the invention of the printed book, or TV, or SNS — and
you start to use it, it’s like you ① are putting on a new
kind  of  goggles,  with  their  own  special  colors  and
lenses. Each set of goggles you put on ② make you
see  things  differently.  So  when  you  start  to  watch
television,  before  you  absorb  the  message  of  any
particular TV show — whether it’s Wheel of Fortune or
The Wire — you start ③ seeing the world as being

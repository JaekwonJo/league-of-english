Whales  are  highly  efficient  at  carbon  storage.  When
they die, each whale sequesters an average of 30 tons
of  carbon  dioxide,  taking  that  carbon  out  of  the
atmosphere for centuries. For comparison, the average
tree absorbs only 48 pounds of CO2 a year. From a
climate  perspective,  each  whale  is  the  marine
equivalent  of  thousands  of  trees.  Whales  also  help
sequester  carbon  by  fertilizing  the  ocean  as  they
release  nutrient-rich  waste,  in  turn  increasing
phytoplankton  populations,  which  also  sequester
carbon  ―  leading  some  scientists  to  call  them  the
“engineers   of   marine   ecosystems.”  In  2019,
economists  from  the  International  Monetary  Fund
(IMF) estimated the value of the ecosystem services
provided by each whale at over $2 million USD. They
called for a new global program of economic incentives
to  return  whale  populations  to  preindustrial  whaling
levels as one example of a “nature-based solution” to
climate change. Calls are now being made for a global
whale  restoration  program,  to  slow  down  climate
change.

① active animals cleaning the waste water from the land
② consumers primarily eating harmful species in the
ocean
③ natural cleaners degrading ocean plastic pollution
④ clever predators hunting effectively while having a
minimal impact on ecosystems
⑤ important agents purifying the marine environment by
holding carbon

You hear again and again that some of the greatest
composers were misunderstood in their own day. Not
everyone  could  understand  the  compositions  of
Beethoven,  Brahms,  or  Stravinsky  in  their  day.  The
reason  for  this  initial  lack  of  acceptance  is
unfamiliarity.  The  musical  forms,  or  ideas  expressed
within  them,  were  completely  new.  And  yet,  this  is
exactly one of the things that makes them so great.
Effective  composers  have  their  own  ideas.  Have  you
ever seen the classic movie Amadeus? The composer
Antonio  Salieri  is  the  “host”  of  this  movie;  he’s
depicted  as  one  of  the  most  famous  non-great
composers ― he lived at the time of Mozart and was
completely overshadowed by him. Now, Salieri wasn’t
a bad composer; in fact, he was a very good one. But
he wasn’t one of the world’s great composers because
his  work  wasn’t  original. What  he  wrote  sounded
just  like  what  everyone  else  was  composing  at
the time.
① His works were distinguishable from others'
② His compositions missed novelty and unusualness
③ His music was not known to the public at the time
④ His compositions were too complex to be comprehend
⑤ His music was full of emotions, different from the ones
used by others

Every time a new medium comes along — whether it’s
the invention of the printed book, or TV, or SNS — and
you start to use it, it’s like you are putting on a new
kind of goggles, with their own special colors and
lenses. Each set of goggles you put on makes you see
things  differently.  So  when  you  start  to  watch
television,  before  you  absorb  the  message  of  any
particular TV show — whether it’s Wheel of Fortune or
The Wire — you start to see the world as being shaped
like television itself. That’s why Marshall McLuhan said
that every time a new medium comes along — a new
way for humans to communicate — it has buried in it a
message.  It  is  gently  guiding  us  to  see  the  world
according to a new set of codes. The way information
gets to you, McLuhan argued, is more important than
the information itself. TV teaches you that the world is
fast; that it’s about surfaces and appearances.

다음 글에서 밑줄 친 “luminiferious ether”에 대한 설명
으로 옳은 것은? [33]
Concepts are vital to human survival, but we must also
be careful with them because concepts open the door
to essentialism. They encourage us to see things that
aren’t  present.  Stuart  Firestein  opens  his  book,
Ignorance, with an old proverb, “It is very difficult to
find a black cat in a dark room, especially when there
is  no  cat.”  This  statement  beautifully  sums  up  the
search  for  essences.  History  has  many  examples  of
scientists  who  searched  fruitlessly  for  an  essence
because  they  used  the  wrong  concept  to  guide  their
hypotheses.   Firestein   gives   the   example   of
luminiferous ether, a mysterious substance that was
thought to fill the universe so that light would have a
medium to move through. The ether was a black cat,
writes Firestein, and physicists had been theorizing in
a dark room, and then experimenting in it, looking for
evidence of a cat that did not exist.
① a form of energy that is seldom found in the natural
world
② a material that was eventually confirmed to exist
③ a mysterious form of dark force used by Jedi masters
④ a measure used by scientists to identify the speed of
light
⑤ a non-existent medium that scientists believed light
moved through

1 번 - ⑤   지문에서, whales also help sequester carbon이라
고 했으므로, 위 글의 밑줄 친 문장이 지칭하는 것은 ⑤ 이다.
2 번 - ②   이 글의 주제는 위대한 작곡가들은 그들만의 독창적
인 아이디어를 통해 다른 사람들과 차별화되며, 처음에는 이해받
지 못했을지라도 결국 그들의 혁신성으로 인해 위대함을 인정받았
다는 것이다. 특히 살리에리와 모차르트를 비교하면서, 독창성의
부족이 위대한 작곡가로서의 성공을 가로막는 요소임을 강조하고
있으므로, 밑줄 친 부분인 '그가 쓴 글은 당시 다른 사람들이 작곡
하던 것과 똑같이 들렸다.'가 의미하는 바로 가장 적절한 것은 ②
'그의 작곡은 참신함과 특이함을 놓쳤다'이다.
3 번 - ⑤   위 글에선, 전달하는 메세지가 아닌, 각 매체 그 자체
에 의해 영향을 받는다고 이야기를 했기 때문에, 위 글의 밑줄 친
문장이 의미하는 바로 가장 적절한 것은 ⑤ 이다.
4 번 - ⑤   개념이 중요하지만, 그것은 자칫 존재하지 않는 것에
집중하도록 하게할 수 있다는 내용의 글이고, luminiferous
ether는 그 예시로 사용하고 있기 때문에, luminiferous ether에
대한 설명으로 옳은 것은 ⑤ '과학자들이 빛이 통과한다고 믿는 존
재하지 않은 매개체'가 적절하다.
5 번 - ⑤   위대한 작곡가들의 새롭고 낯선 음악이 대중과 비평
가들에게 처음에는 받아들여지지 않았던 상황을 의미하므로, 밑줄
친 부분이 의미하는 것은 ⑤이다.
6 번 - ③   정보가 전달되는 방식이 그 정보의 해석과 이해에 큰
영향을 미친다고 강조하고 있다. 매체가 사람들의 인식을 형성하
는 방식을 설명하는 글이므로, ③이 적절하다.
7 번 - ③   개념은 인간 생존에 필수적이지만, 존재하지 않는 것
들을 보도록 부추기는 본질주의로 이어질 수 있기 때문에 주의해
야 한다는 내용의 글이다. 밑줄 친 부분 이후의 내용에서 잘못된
개념들이 가설을 이끌어 헛되이 본질을 탐색했던 과학자들의 예시
가 많다며, Firestein은 빛이 통과할 수 있도록 우주를 가득 채워
줄 것이라 생각되는 신비한 발광 에테르는 검은 고양이고, 물리학
자들은 어두운 방에서 이론을 세우고, 그러고 나서 존재하지 않았
던 고양이라는 증거를 찾으며, 그 안에서 실험을 하고 있었던 것이
었다는 내용으로 보아 고양이라는 개념에 빠져들어 실물로 존재하
지도 않는 것을 존재한다고 믿은 것이므로, ③ '존재하지 않는 무
엇인가를 탐색할 때'가 가장 적절하다.
8 번 - ⑤   '물리학자들이 어두운 방에서 이론을 세우고, 다음에
실험을 하면서 존재하지 않는 고양이의 증거를 찾고 있었다'고 하
였으므로 글에서 밑줄 친 부분이 의미하는 바로 가장 적절한 것은
⑤ '존재하지 않는 것을 검색하는 것의 무의미'이다. [오답노트] ①
과학 연구에서 더 나은 도구의 필요성 ② 새로운 과학 이론 개발의
이점 ③ 구체적인 개념의 존재를 증명하는 것의 어려움 ④ 과학적
실험에서 주의 깊게 관찰하는 것의 중요성
9 번 - ③   잘못된 가정이 이끄는 연구의 결과가 부정적일 수 밖
에 없는 이유를 설명하는 내용의 글이므로, 글의 밑줄 친 문장이
의미하는 바로 가장 적절한 것은 ③이다.
10 번 - ③   개념은 본질주의로 향하여 우리가 존재하지 않는 것
을 보도록 부추기기때문에 에 주의해야 한다는 글로, 밑줄 친 '에
테르가 검은 고양이였다' 라는 의미는 ③ '과학자들은 존재하지 않
았던 아이디어를 찾고 있었다' 를 의미한다.

One valuable technique for getting out of helplessness,
depression, and situations which are predominantly
being run by the thought, “I can’t,” is to choose to be
with other persons who have resolved the problem
with which we struggle. This is one of the great powers
of self-help groups. When we are in a negative state,
we have given a lot of energy to negative thought
forms, and the positive thought forms are weak. Those
who are in a higher vibration are free of the energy
from their negative thoughts and have energized
positive thought forms. Merely to be in their presence
is beneficial. In some self-help groups, this is called
“hanging out with the winners.” The benefit here is on
the psychic level of consciousness, and there is a
transfer of positive energy and relighting of one’s own
latent positive thought forms.

Our emotions are thought to exist because they have
contributed to our survival as a species. Fear has
helped us avoid dangers, expressing anger helps us
scare off threats, and expressing positive emotions
helps us bond with others. From an evolutionary
perspective, an emotion is a kind of “program” that,
when triggered, directs many of our activities
(including attention, perception, memory, movement,
expressions, etc.). For example, fear makes us very
attentive, narrows our perceptual focus to threatening
stimuli, will cause us either to face a situation (fight)
or avoid it (flight), and may cause us to remember an
experience more acutely (so that we avoid the threat
in the future). Regardless of the specific ways in which
they activate our systems, the specific emotions we
possess are thought to exist because they have helped
us (as a species) survive challenges within our
environment long ago. If they had not helped us adapt
and survive, they would not have evolved with us.

You hear again and again that some of the greatest
composers were misunderstood in their own day. Not
everyone could understand the compositions of
Beethoven, Brahms, or Stravinsky in their day. The
reason for this initial lack of acceptance is
unfamiliarity. The musical forms, or ideas expressed
within them, were completely new. And yet, this is
exactly one of the things that makes them so great.
Effective composers have their own ideas. Have you
ever seen the classic movie Amadeus? The composer
Antonio Salieri is the “host” of this movie; he’s
depicted as one of the most famous non-great
composers ― he lived at the time of Mozart and was
completely overshadowed by him. Now, Salieri wasn’t
a bad composer; in fact, he was a very good one. But
he wasn’t one of the world’s great composers because
his work wasn’t original. What he wrote sounded just
like what everyone else was composing at the time.

Every time a new medium comes along — whether it’s
the invention of the printed book, or TV, or SNS — and
you start to use it, it’s like you are putting on a new
kind of goggles, with their own special colors and
lenses. Each set of goggles you put on makes you see
things differently. So when you start to watch
television, before you absorb the message of any
particular TV show — whether it’s Wheel of Fortune or
The Wire — you start to see the world as being shaped
like television itself. That’s why Marshall McLuhan said
that every time a new medium comes along — a new
way for humans to communicate — it has buried in it a
message. It is gently guiding us to see the world
according to a new set of codes. The way information
gets to you, McLuhan argued, is more important than
the information itself. TV teaches you that the world is
fast; that it’s about surfaces and appearances.

Concepts are vital to human survival, but we must also
be careful with them because concepts open the door
to essentialism. They encourage us to see things that
aren’t present. Stuart Firestein opens his book,
Ignorance, with an old proverb, “It is very difficult to
find a black cat in a dark room, especially when there
is no cat.” This statement beautifully sums up the
search for essences. History has many examples of
scientists who searched fruitlessly for an essence
because they used the wrong concept to guide their
hypotheses. Firestein gives the example of
luminiferous ether, a mysterious substance that was
thought to fill the universe so that light would have a
medium to move through. The ether was a black cat,
writes Firestein, and physicists had been theorizing in
a dark room, and then experimenting in it, looking for
evidence of a cat that did not exist.

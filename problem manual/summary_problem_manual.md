As the parent of a gifted child, you need to be aware of
a certain common parent trap. Of course you are a
proud parent, and you should be. While it is very easy
to talk nonstop about your little genius and his or her
remarkable behavior, this can be very stressful on your
child. It is extremely important to limit your bragging
behavior to your very close friends, or your parents.
Gifted children feel pressured when their parents show
them off too much. This behavior creates expectations
that they may not be able to live up to, and also
creates a false sense of self for your child. You want
your child to be who they are, not who they seem to
be as defined by their incredible achievements. If not,
you could end up with a driven perfectionist child or
perhaps a drop-out, or worse.
 According to the passage, parents of gifted children
should be cautious about (A) their child's
abilities excessively, as this can lead to unrealistic
(B) and unnecessary stress for the child.
① criticizing - confidence
② ignoring - opportunities
③ praising - expectations
④ complimenting - benefits
⑤ underestimating - challenges

One valuable technique for getting out of helplessness,
depression, and situations which are predominantly
being run by the thought, “I can’t,” is to choose to be
with other persons who have resolved the problem
with which we struggle. This is one of the great powers
of self-help groups. When we are in a negative state,
we have given a lot of energy to negative thought
forms, and the positive thought forms are weak. Those
who are in a higher vibration are free of the energy
from their negative thoughts and have energized
positive thought forms. Merely to be in their presence
is beneficial. In some self-help groups, this is called
“hanging out with the winners.” The benefit here is on
the psychic level of consciousness, and there is a
transfer of positive energy and relighting of one’s own
latent positive thought forms.
* latent: 잠재적인
 (A) others who have succeeded can help
individuals regain their (B) and shift away
from negative thinking.
① Averting - confusion
② Hanging out with - depression
③ Talking behind - enthusiasm
④ Shying away from - confidence
⑤ Connecting with - motivation

Our emotions are thought to exist because they have
contributed to our survival as a species. Fear has
helped us avoid dangers, expressing anger helps us
scare off threats, and expressing positive emotions
helps us bond with others. From an evolutionary
perspective, an emotion is a kind of “program” that,
when triggered, directs many of our activities
(including attention, perception, memory, movement,
expressions, etc.). For example, fear makes us very
attentive, narrows our perceptual focus to threatening
stimuli, will cause us either to face a situation (fight)
or avoid it (flight), and may cause us to remember an
experience more acutely (so that we avoid the threat
in the future). Regardless of the specific ways in which
they activate our systems, the specific emotions we
possess are thought to exist because they have helped
us (as a species) survive challenges within our
environment long ago. If they had not helped us adapt
and survive, they would not have evolved with us.
 Emotions have evolved as adaptive (A)
that guide our responses to environmental challenges,
helping to enhance our (B) survival.
① reactions - national
② responses - illegal
③ mechanisms - species
④ programs - revive
⑤ mechanisms - immortal

By improving accessibility of the workplace for workers
that are typically at a disadvantage in the labour
market, AI can improve inclusiveness in the workplace.
AI-powered assistive devices to aid workers with
visual, speech or hearing difficulties are becoming
more widespread, improving the access to, and the
quality of work for people with disabilities. For
example, speech recognition solutions for people with
dysarthric voices, or live captioning systems for deaf
and hard of hearing people can facilitate
communication with colleagues and access to jobs
where inter-personal communication is necessary. AI
can also enhance the capabilities of low-skilled
workers, with potentially positive effects on their
wages and career prospects. For example, AI’s
capacity to translate written and spoken word in real-
time can improve the performance of non-native
speakers in the workplace. Moreover, recent
developments in AI-powered text generators can
instantly improve the performance of lower-skilled
individuals in domains such as writing, coding or
customer service.
*dysarthric: (신경 장애로 인한) 구음(構音) 장애의
AI technology can help create a more (A)
workplace environment by (B) workplace
accessibility and work quality for workers with
disabilities, while also enhancing the job performance
of low-skilled employees.
① rounded - strengthening
② productive - prohibiting
③ competitive - including
④ secure - reducing
⑤ undesirable - denying

Whales are highly efficient at carbon storage. When
they die, each whale sequesters an average of 30 tons
of carbon dioxide, taking that carbon out of the
atmosphere for centuries. For comparison, the average
tree absorbs only 48 pounds of CO2 a year. From a
climate perspective, each whale is the marine
equivalent of thousands of trees. Whales also help
sequester carbon by fertilizing the ocean as they
release nutrient-rich waste, in turn increasing
phytoplankton populations, which also sequester
carbon ― leading some scientists to call them the
“engineers of marine ecosystems.” In 2019,
economists from the International Monetary Fund
(IMF) e

One valuable technique for getting out of helplessness,
depression, and situations which are predominantly
being run by the thought, “I can’t,” is to choose to be
with other persons who have (A) [raised / resolved]
the problem with which we struggle. This is one of the
great powers of self-help groups. When we are in a
negative state, we have given a lot of energy to
negative thought forms, and the positive thought
forms are weak. Those who are in a higher vibration
are free of the energy from their negative thoughts
and have energized positive thought forms. Merely to
be in their (B) [presence / absence] is beneficial. In
some self-help groups, this is called “hanging out with
the winners.” The benefit here is on the psychic level of
consciousness, and there is a (C) [transfer /
transformation] of positive energy and relighting of
one’s own latent positive thought forms.
* latent: 잠재적인
① resolved - presence - transformation
② resolved - absence - transformation
③ resolved - presence - transfer
④ raised - presence - transformation
⑤ raised - absence - transfer

Our emotions are thought to exist because they have
contributed to our survival as a species. Fear has
helped us avoid dangers, expressing anger helps us
scare off threats, and expressing positive emotions
helps us bond with others. From an evolutionary
perspective, an emotion is a kind of “program” that,
when (A) [eliminated / triggered], directs many of
our activities (including attention, perception, memory,
movement, expressions, etc.). For example, fear
makes us very attentive, narrows our perceptual focus
to threatening stimuli, will cause us either to face a
situation (fight) or avoid it (flight), and may cause us
to remember an experience more acutely (so that we
avoid the threat in the future). Regardless of the
specific ways in which they (B) [activate / weaken]
our systems, the specific emotions we possess are
thought to exist because they have helped us (as a
species) survive challenges within our environment
long ago. If they had not helped us (C) [adapt /
resist] and survive, they would not have evolved with
us.
① triggered - weaken - resist
② eliminated - activate - resist
③ eliminated - weaken - adapt
④ triggered - activate - adapt
⑤ eliminated - activate - adapt

By improving accessibility of the workplace for workers
that are typically at a disadvantage in the labour
market, AI can improve (A) [exclusiveness /
inclusiveness] in the workplace. AI-powered assistive
devices to aid workers with visual, speech or hearing
difficulties are becoming more widespread, improving
the access to, and the quality of work for people with
disabilities. For example, speech recognition solutions
for people with dysarthric voices, or live captioning
systems for deaf and hard of hearing people can
facilitate communication with colleagues and access to
jobs where (B) [interpersonal / intrapersonal]
communication is necessary. AI can also enhance the
capabilities of low-skilled workers, with potentially
positive effects on their wages and career prospects.
For example, AI’s capacity to translate written and
spoken word in real-time can guarantee the (C)
[productivty / predominance] the performance of
non-native speakers in the workplace. Moreover,
recent developments in AI-powered text generators
can instantly improve the performance of lower-skilled
individuals in domains such as writing, coding or
customer service.
*dysarthric: (신경 장애로 인한) 구음(構音) 장애의
① inclusiveness - interpersonal - productivty
② exclusiveness - interpersonal - productivty
③ inclusiveness - interpersonal - predominance
④ exclusiveness - intrapersonal - productivty
⑤ inclusiveness - intrapersonal - predominance

You hear again and again that some of the greatest
composers were misunderstood in their own day. Not
everyone could understand the compositions of
Beethoven, Brahms, or Stravinsky in their day. The
reason for this initial lack of (A) [knowledge /
ignorance] is unfamiliarity. The musical forms, or
ideas expressed within them, were completely new.
And yet, this is exactly one of the things that makes
them so (B) [ordinary / exceptional]. Effective
composers have their own ideas. Have you ever seen
the classic movie Amadeus? The composer Antonio
Salieri is the “host” of this movie; he’s depicted as one
of the most famous non-great composers ― he lived at
the time of Mozart and was completely (C)
[overshadowed / brightened] by him. Now, Salieri
wasn’t a bad composer; in fact, he was a very good
one. But he wasn’t one of the world’s great composers
because his work wasn’t original. What he wrote
sounded just like what everyone else was composing
at the time.
① ignorance - ordinary - overshadowed
② ignorance - exceptional - brightened
③ knowledge - exceptional - brightened
④ knowledge - ordinary - brightened
⑤ knowledge - exceptional - overshadowed

Why do we have the illusion that cramming for an
exam is the best learning strategy? Because we are
unable to differentiate between the various sections of
our memory. Immediately after reading our textbook
or our class notes, information is fully (A) [removed
/ embedded] in our mind. It sits in our conscious
working memory, in an active form. We feel as if we
know it, because it is present in our short-term storage
space ... but this short-term section has (B) [nothing
/ something] to do with the long-term memory that
we will need in order to recall the same information a
few days later. After a few seconds or minutes,
working memory already starts disappearing, and after
a few days, the effect becomes enormous: unless you
retest your knowledge, memory (C) [vanishes /
banishes]

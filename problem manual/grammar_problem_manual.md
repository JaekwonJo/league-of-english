One valuable technique for getting out of helplessness,
depression, and situations which are predominantly
being run by the thought, “I can’t,” is to choose to be
with other persons ① who have resolved the problem
which we struggle. This is ② one great power of self-
help groups. When we are in a negative state, we have
given a lot of energy to negative thought forms, and
the positive thought forms are weak. ③ Those in a
higher vibration are free of the energy from their
negative thoughts and have energized positive thought
forms. ④ Just being around them is beneficial. In some
self-help groups, this is called “hanging out with the
winners.” The benefit here is on the psychic level of
consciousness, and there is a transfer of positive
energy and ⑤ relighting one’s own latent positive
thought forms.

Our emotions are thought to exist because they have
contributed to our survival as a species. Fear has ①
helped us avoid dangers, expressing anger helps us
scare off threats, and expressing positive emotions
helps us bond with others. From an evolutionary
perspective, an emotion is a kind of “program” that, ②
when triggered, directs many of our activities
(including attention, perception, memory, movement,
expressions, etc.). For example, fear makes us very
attentive, narrows our perceptual focus to threatening
stimuli, will cause us either to face a situation (fight)
or ③ avoids it (flight), and may cause us to remember
an experience more acutely (so that we avoid the
threat in the future). Regardless of the specific ways in
which they activate our systems, the specific emotions
we possess ④ are thought to exist because they have
helped us (as a species) survive challenges within our
environment long ago. If they ⑤ had not helped us
adapt and survive, they would not have evolved with
us.

Every time a new medium comes along — whether it’s
the invention of the printed book, or TV, or SNS — and
you start to use it, it’s like you ① are putting on a new
kind of goggles, with their own special colors and
lenses. Each set of goggles you put on ② make you
see things differently. So when you start to watch
television, before you absorb the message of any
particular TV show — whether it’s Wheel of Fortune or
The Wire — you start ③ seeing the world as being
shaped like television itself. That’s ④ why Marshall
McLuhan said that every time a new medium comes
along — a new way for humans to communicate — it
has buried in it a message. It is gently guiding us to
see the world according to a new set of codes. The way
information gets to you, McLuhan argued, is more
important than the information itself. TV teaches you
⑤ that the world is fast; that it’s about surfaces and
appearances.

One valuable technique for getting out of helplessness,
depression, and situations which are predominantly
being run by the thought, “I can’t,” is to choose to be
with other persons who have resolved the problem
with which we struggle. This is one of the great powers
of self-help groups. When we are in a negative state,
we have given a lot of energy to negative thought
forms, and the positive thought forms are weak. Those
who are in a higher vibration are free of the energy
from their negative thoughts and have energized
positive thought forms. Merely to be in their presence
is beneficial. In some self-help groups, this is called
“hanging out with the winners.” The benefit here is on
the psychic level of consciousness, and there is a
transfer of positive energy and relighting of one’s own
latent positive thought forms.
* latent: 잠재적인
① the importance of positive energy in daily life
② ways to smoothly resolve conflicts with others
③ feetures of people with a strong sense of selflessness
④ learning the secrets to winning from successful people
⑤ shifting away from a negative mindset with positive
people

Our emotions are thought to exist because they have
contributed to our survival as a species. Fear has
helped us avoid dangers, expressing anger helps us
scare off threats, and expressing positive emotions
helps us bond with others. From an evolutionary
perspective, an emotion is a kind of “program” that,
when triggered, directs many of our activities
(including attention, perception, memory, movement,
expressions, etc.). For example, fear makes us very
attentive, narrows our perceptual focus to threatening
stimuli, will cause us either to face a situation (fight)
or avoid it (flight), and may cause us to remember an
experience more acutely (so that we avoid the threat
in the future). Regardless of the specific ways in which
they activate our systems, the specific emotions we
possess are thought to exist because they have helped
us (as a species) survive challenges within our
environment long ago. If they had not helped us adapt
and survive, they would not have evolved with us.
① novel designs of emotions to direct our behaviors
② significance of emotional suspension in a modern life
③ circumlocutory expression and creativity caused by
emotions
④ the evolutionary advantage of emotions in human
survival
⑤ emotions as a imperative source of entertainment
expression

Whales are highly efficient at carbon storage. When
they die, each whale sequesters an average of 30 tons
of carbon dioxide, taking that carbon out of the
atmosphere for centuries. For comparison, the average
tree absorbs only 48 pounds of CO2 a year. From a
climate perspective, each whale is the marine
equivalent of thousands of trees. Whales also help
sequester carbon by fertilizing the ocean as they
release nutrient-rich waste, in turn increasing
phytoplankton populations, which also sequester
carbon ― leading some scientists to call them the
“engineers of marine ecosystems.” In 2019,
economists from the International Monetary Fund
(IMF) estimated the value of the ecosystem services
provided by each whale at over $2 million USD. They
called for a new global program of economic incentives
to return whale populations to preindustrial whaling
levels as one example of a “nature-based solution” to
climate change. Calls are now being made for a global
whale restoration program, to slow down climate
change.
*sequester: 격리하다 **phytoplankton: 식물성 플랑크톤
① global efforts to stop illegal whaling
② whales endagered by global warming
③ the way whales help mitigate climate change
④ whales' capacity to sequester themselves from air
⑤ reasons and the ways whales sequester carbon in their
bodies

You hear again and again that some of the greatest
composers were misunderstood in their own day. Not
everyone could understand the compositions of
Beethoven, Brahms, or Stravinsky in their day. The
reason for this initial lack of acceptance is
unfamiliarity. The musical forms, or ideas expressed
within them, were completely new. And yet, this is
exactly one of the things that makes them so great.
Effective composers have their own ideas. Have you
ever seen the classic movie Amadeus? The composer
Antonio Salieri is the “host” of this movie; he’s
depicted as one of the most famous non-great
composers ― he lived at the time of Mozart and was
completely overshadowed by him. Now, Salieri wasn’t
a bad composer; in fact, he was a very good one. But
he wasn’t one of the world’s great composers because
his work wasn’t original. What he wrote sounded just
like what everyone else was composing at the time.
① the importance of originality in music composition
② the success of composers who copied others' styles
③ the importance of music education in the 18th century
④ the influence of classical music on modern
compositions
⑤ the role of film in shaping the reputation of composers
like Mozart

Every time a new medium comes along — whether it’s
the invention of the printed book, or TV, or SNS — and
you start to use it, it’s like you are putting on a new
kind of goggles, with their own special colors and
lenses. Each set of goggles you put on makes you see
things differently. So when you start to watch
television, before you absorb the message of any
particular TV show — whether it’s Wheel of Fortune or
The Wire — you start to see the world as being shaped
like television itself. That’s why Marshall McLuhan said
that every time a new medium comes along — a new
way for humans to communicate — it has buried in it a
message. It is gently guiding us to see the world
according to a new set of codes. The way information
gets to you, McLuhan argued, is more important than
the information itself. TV teaches you that the world is
fast; that it’s about surfaces a

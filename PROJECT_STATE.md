# PROJECT_STATE.md

## What we're building
- API-only CSAT English generator that transforms every problem type (summary, grammar, vocabulary, blank, title, theme, inference, etc.) straight from user-uploaded passages; only order and insertion stay scripted until their API prompts finish QA.
- Persistent problem library that stores validated OpenAI outputs with source metadata, exposure tracking plans, smart rotation, and moderator controls so each student sees unseen, high-quality items first.
- Teacher/student portals built on trustworthy content, per-problem reporting, vocabulary drills, ranking, and analytics so moderators can retire low-quality items immediately.

## Stack & Commands
- Node.js 20 Express backend with React 19 (CRA) frontend; lucide-react powers shared icons/components.
- SQL.js currently persists documents and generated problems; PostgreSQL migration remains queued after cache + rotation metadata stabilise.
- Preferred dev command: `npm run dev:all` (API 5000 + client 3000). `npm run dev`/`npm run client` stay available for single-target work.
- Test with `npm test` (Node test runner over `server/tests`) and lint with `npm run lint` (ESLint via `.eslintrc.cjs`).
- Refresh manuals via `node scripts/update-problem-manuals.js` to keep Wolgo-aligned prompts current while expanding API prompts across types.

## Decisions (key)
- Rule-based fallbacks are retired for all types except order/insertion; if the API pipeline cannot return a validated item we queue regeneration instead of shipping templated questions.
- Every generated problem is stored in the problem library with source metadata, validation status, and exposure tracking before it reaches students.
- Study sessions must draw from cached, unseen problems first; once a student exhausts the cache for a type we invoke the API again just for that learner.
- Reporting flow lets students flag problematic items; moderators can deactivate them so the cache and rotation immediately exclude the issue.
- API base URL continues to come from `client/.env` (`REACT_APP_API_URL`); auth tokens stay in `localStorage` until refresh tokens are introduced.

## Current Stage
- Queue-backed generation and the grammar underline auto-heal are stable, and `npm test`/`npm run lint` continue to pass; docs re-read on 2025-09-30 so today's push keeps the Study spinner localisation, grammar QA, and client automation front-and-centre.

## Next 3 (priority)
1. **Localise the Study spinner + vocab warm-up.** Swap the remaining English strings to Korean, fix the mojibake so the countdown screen feels native, and keep the first impression on-brand.
2. **Run end-to-end Study QA for grammar batches.** Launch `npm run dev:all`, request a grammar set, and confirm all five rebuilt underlines render correctly from OpenAI → API → React before student pilots.
3. **Add client-side tests/linting for spinner + countdown UI.** Extend the test harness to `client/` so localisation and underline rendering stay regression-proof instead of relying on manual checks.

## Known issues
- Study loading UI still needs manual QA: validate countdown completion, keyboard focus, and underline rebuild behaviour with live API payloads.
- Loading spinner and vocab warm-up strings remain English with mojibake on some Windows browsers; replace with Korean copy and normalised encoding.
- Client-side linting and automated tests are missing, so React countdown and loading widgets rely on manual checks.
- Order and insertion problem types are still rule-based; Wolgo-aligned OpenAI prompts plus validators are required before we retire the scripted path.

## Resolved (2025-10-02 - irrelevant sentence deterministic manual)
- Replaced the ad-hoc 무관 문장 가이드(`problem manual/irrelevant_problem_manual.md`) with the deterministic Irrelevant Master spec (`docs/problem-templates/irrelevant-master.md`, `irrelevant_problem_manual.md`) so 흐름상 무관한 문장도 같은 규격으로 재현돼요.
- Added `generateIrrelevant` to the AI generator + CSAT 세트/스마트 출제 루프에 연결하고, `problem-templates.json` 프롬프트까지 맞춰 OpenAI로 문제를 뽑아 저장·노출 차단까지 한 번에 돌아가요.
- Exposed metadata(`irrelevantType`, `defectAxis`)와 `출처│` 규칙을 적용해 QA/로깅과 문서 흐름이 다른 유형과 동일하게 맞춰졌어요.

## Resolved (2025-10-02 - implicit inference deterministic manual)
- Shipped the K-CSAT Implicit Master spec (`docs/problem-templates/implicit-master.md`, `implicit_problem_manual.md`, `problem manual/implicit_meaning_manual.md`) so 함축적 의미 추론도 다른 유형처럼 결정형으로 재현돼요.
- Added `generateImplicit` to the AI problem service + routes so `implicit` 타입이 OpenAI로 생성/저장되고, CSAT 세트·스마트 출제에서도 바로 고를 수 있어요.
- Updated `problem-templates.json` 프롬프트와 expose/캐시 로직까지 묶어 `출처│`·결함 태그·노출 차단 규칙을 그대로 따르게 했어요.

## Resolved (2025-10-01 - docs nickname cleanup)
- Replaced the personal nickname with `LoE관리자` across status docs to keep published materials professional and avoid leaking DC forum handles.
- Updated README and CLAUDE overview so future contributors see the new naming instantly.
- Confirmed no other files reference the deprecated nickname by searching the repository.

## Resolved (2025-10-01 - grammar underline auto-heal)
- Patched `formatGrammarProblem` to rebuild missing `<u>...</u>` spans from the provided options (대소문자/문장부호 차이 허용), 추가 실패 진단을 붙이고 Node 테스트로 검증해 4-underlines payload에서도 더 이상 500이 나지 않게 했습니다.
- Verified the fix locally with `npm test` and `npm run lint` (both green on Windows/WSL).

## Resolved (2025-09-30 - grammar manual v7.1 + tooling sync)
- Upgraded `grammar_problem_manual.md` (root + problem manual) to Master v7.1, documenting the Style Contract/Variation Engine 분리와 어법·어휘 통합 패턴 가이드.
- Confirmed `npm test` (Node test runner) and `npm run lint` succeed on Windows/WSL after the earlier script + ESLint config fixes.
- Captured follow-up priorities (loading UI QA, manual propagation, client lint/tests) so the team knows where to focus next.

## Resolved (2025-10-02 - deterministic title manual)
- Added the K-CSAT Title Master deterministic manual (`docs/problem-templates/title-master.md`, `title_problem_manual.md`, `problem manual/title_problem_manual.md`) covering Style Contract, variation engine, 오답 유형, 루브릭.
- Updated the OpenAI title generator prompt/validation so it consumes the manual snippet, enforces 5 options(6~12 words), Korean question text, and Korean rationale.

## Resolved (2025-10-02 - summary AB deterministic manual)
- Replaced the summary(빈칸 A/B) manuals (`docs/problem-templates/summary-two-blank.md`, `summary_problem_manual.md`, `problem manual/summary_problem_manual.md`) with the deterministic Style Contract/Variation guide.
- Hardened `summaryTemplate`/`generateSummary` prompts and validation: new 한국어 지시문, 18~35 word single-sentence requirement, ①~⑤ en-dash pairs, Korean rationale, `출처│` 라벨.

## Resolved (2025-10-02 - cloze blank deterministic manual)
- Added the blank/cloze Style Contract manual (`docs/problem-templates/blank-master.md`, `blank_problem_manual.md`, `problem manual/blank_problem_manual.md`) covering four pattern families and distractor defects.
- Updated `generateBlank` prompt/validation to rely on the manual, enforce 5 options with circled digits, question whitelist, Korean explanation, placeholder detection, and `출처│` 라벨.

## Resolved (2025-10-02 - topic deterministic manual)
- Added the K-CSAT Topic Master manual (`docs/problem-templates/topic-master.md`, `theme_problem_manual.md`, `problem manual/theme_problem_manual.md`) so 주제 문제가 논지+범위 기준으로 재현 가능.
- Hardened `generateTheme` prompt/validation: 5 options(6~14 단어), 한국어 해설, `출처│` 라벨, 오답 결함 메타태그.

## Resolved (2025-09-30 - doc sync + CLI verification)
- Re-read PROJECT_STATE.md, README.md, and BUILDLOG.md, then re-ran `npm test` and `npm run lint` to capture the current failure messages so the status docs stay actionable while the fixes are pending.
- Recorded the exact Windows glob error and ESLint config gap inside the status docs to guide whoever tackles the automation backlog next.

## Resolved (2025-09-30)
- Re-synced PROJECT_STATE.md, README.md, and BUILDLOG.md to spotlight the queue-ready backend, refreshed Top 3 priorities, and the temporary `node --test` workaround.
- Re-ran `node --test server/tests/aiProblemService.test.js` to confirm circled-digit formatting and exposure tracking stay green while the npm script fix is pending.

## Resolved (2025-09-28)
- Added `problem_exposures` table + `markExposures` so cached questions only appear once per student.
- Reworked `/generate/csat-set` to fetch unseen cached items first, then persist fresh OpenAI batches, and queue OpenAI calls with retry/backoff.
- Updated the Wolgo grammar template/normaliser to keep circled digits + source labels intact and introduced node-test coverage for summary/grammar/exposure flows.

## Resolved (2025-09-26)
- Added `server/utils/summaryTemplate.js` and rewrote `aiProblemService` to build/validate CSAT-style summary problems (A/B blanks, circled options, source labels).
- Integrated the Wolgo grammar template via `server/utils/eobeopTemplate.js`, removed basic/advanced fallbacks, and returned API-only grammar batches with circled options and underlined passages.
- Rebuilt `/generate/csat-set` route to enforce 5-question steps (max 20), dispatch batched generators, and normalize responses for the React study screen.
- Updated the study client (`useStudySession`, `StudyConfig`, `ProblemDisplay`, `GrammarProblemDisplay`) to request 5-at-once, render list mode cleanly, and support the new summary/grammar data shape.
